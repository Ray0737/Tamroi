## Educational Features + Content Safety (2026-07-02 → 07-04)

| Unsolved History debates | ✅ Done | js/debates.js · `history_debates`, `debate_votes`, stats RPC |
| Jigsaw Learning v2 (GPS checkpoint + timeline merge) | ✅ Done | `patch_jigsaw_v2.sql` · GPS-gated visit + recall quiz gate + structured summary + drag-to-reorder merge vote, server-side reward trigger |
| Lore pre/post-test | ✅ Done | `patch_prepost.sql` · `user_lore_assessments`, per-phase scores |
| Review-status enforcement | ✅ Done | `patch_review_status.sql` · client filters `review_status = 'approved'` |
| Forum probation + PDPA consent | ✅ Done | `patch_child_safety.sql` · new-account post hold, age consent at onboarding |

| Raid notification deep-link | ✅ Done | Was a deferred gap; notification opens the raid lobby |
| Rama-line kings removed from pool | ✅ Done | `patch_remove_all_rama.sql` (two earlier attempts had silently failed) |

## Map & Capture Overhaul (2026-07-04 → 07-05)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Light-theme map | ✅ Done | White CartoDB tiles, darker fog, adapted marker/UI colors |
| Walk-cell fog reveal | ✅ Done | FogGrid cells revealed by walking; gated on GPS accuracy ≤100m; localStorage-only (per-device) |
| Fog rebuild fixes | ✅ Done | Thailand-bbox outer ring; walk cells no longer cancel cleared district holes (bbox intersection) |
| Encounter Key | ✅ Done | `patch_encounter_key.sql` · watchtower check-in gates A-tier encounters |
| C-Class proximity capture | ✅ Done | 80m circle, fog-visible markers, tap-to-capture sheet; `patch_c_class_proximity.sql` (fig-c-21/22 + fig-c-14 coords) |
| Captured figures hidden at init | ✅ Done | Map fetches user captures in `loadDistrictData` |
| Lore unlock persistence fix | ✅ Done | `user_lore` upsert used wrong column name (`lore_id` → `lore_node_id`); writes silently failed since launch |
| Figure cameo on chain completion | ✅ Done | Linked figure + speech bubble in the chain-complete sheet |
| Settings overhaul | ✅ Done | Edit username, notifications toggle, GPS permission status, home district picker, profile picture |

| Figure Biography + Relation Graph | ✅ Done | `patch_figure_bio.sql` · `figure_relations` table · extended figure modal (bio_th, birth/death year, relation chips, related lore, related locations) · `FigureGraphModule` SVG canvas with pan/zoom/drag/focus animations · `MapModule.flyToLocation` |

### Known Gaps (Deferred)

- CoopModule GPS gate for mission checkin (currently DB-only, no distance check)
- Walk-cell fog is device-local (localStorage), not synced per account — batched-write sync planned
- Group mission cards render in two places (Mission tab + Guild panel) without shared refresh
- `figures.era` column never applied to live DB — era text always falls back to generic label
